Self study 'learning Rust' assignments

## Structure
To participate, clone/fork this repository and branch it. Create a folder named with your name under the specific week and create a pull request for your branch when you have completed the assignments.

## Curriculum
Enumerations indicate the level of completion: 1. is expected and higher is better.

### Week 1-2
#### Assignment 1: Hello, World!
1. Install the Rust SDK: https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/ . Then write, compile and run a 'Hello, World!' program

#### Assignment 2: Fibonacci Sequence generator
1. Write a program `fib(n)` that takes an input integer `n` and returns the n'th fibonacci number. E.g., the 7th fibonacci number is 13 (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13), so `fib(7)` should return 13. For bonus points experiment with different implementations of the algorithm (recursive, iterative, etc.)
Fibonacci numbers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

#### Assignment 3: Guessing Game
1. Write a program for the Guessing Game https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/guessing-game.html

### Week 3-4
#### Assignment 1: Reverse string algorithm
1. Write a function that takes a string as an input and returns a string with all the characters in reverse order, e.g. reverse_string("Palmtree") should return "eertmlaP" and reverse_string("maoam") should return "maoam".
2. Modify the function to perform the reversal without the use of builtin string functionality.

#### Assignment 2: Quicksort algorithm
1. Write a sorting function that implements the quicksort algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort . It should sort a list of integers in ascending order.
2. Modify the algorithm to sort in descending order.
3. Modify the algorithm to accept a list containing any comparable typed objects.

#### Assignment 3: Simple calculator app
1. Write a program that acts as a simple calculator. It should accept input from the console in the form of mathematical operations, e.g. "5 + 10" and then return the result. It should be able to evaluate simple operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
2. Modify the application to be able to accept compounded operations such as "5 + 2 * 3". Remember to obey the operator precedence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations 
3. Modify the application to accept more complex operations such as exponent, square root, logarithm, etc.

### Week 5-6
#### Assignment: Producer-Consumer concurrency

### Week 7-8
#### Assignment: TCP Server and Client

### Week 9-10
#### Assignment: Wikipedia scraper

### Week 11-12
#### Assignment: Tic Tac Toe game
